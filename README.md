# Simulation for a Tentacle Arm in Blender
Created a simulation for moving around a 3d tentacle arm in blender using blender modals and python code. The simulation will output the coordinates of the arms furthest point to a file outputtest.txt. The simulation will read in locations for the arm from test.txt. The user can move the arm around by pressing g when selecting the furthest point on the tentacle arm. Then send the coordinates to the output file by pressing s. the simulation will the move between the point when the arm was grabbed to where it was moved and output all the coordinates to the test.txt file.
